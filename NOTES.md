remember, the router is set to assign a constant ip to synchub -- both if synchub is connected through wifi or via ethernet

ok, no. setting that the same is causing the router to go away.

//

host: synchub
u: pi
p: lonelyghosts

My router is 300Mbps.

Many individual wireless routers and other access points support up to approximately 250 connected devices. 

A Wi-Fi router rated at 300 Mbps with 100 devices connected, for example, can only offer on average 3 Mbps to each of them (300/100=3). (https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-devices-can-share-a-wifi-network-818298)

...which is fine. so this could work.

extending it probably works. and I have the hardware.



===> 
need an interface to show how many devices have pinged within the last 1.5 seconds

going to put the synchub wifi to studio wifi

and connect the router via ethernet:

unit -> broadcast -> router -> broadcast -> hub -> broadcast -> router -> broadcast -> unit
vs
unit -> broadcast -> router -> hub -> router -> broadcast -> unit

eliminates two broadcasts, so could have an effect.

exhibition checklist

make a SD clone

ok, 53 are believablely connected to the GL now. but syncing is a little challenging.

I think I need to restrict the number of neighbors.
