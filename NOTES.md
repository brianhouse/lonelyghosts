My router is 300Mbps.

Many individual wireless routers and other access points support up to approximately 250 connected devices. 

A Wi-Fi router rated at 300 Mbps with 100 devices connected, for example, can only offer on average 3 Mbps to each of them (300/100=3). (https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-devices-can-share-a-wifi-network-818298)

...which is fine. so this could work.

extending it probably works. and I have the hardware.



===> 
need an interface to show how many devices have pinged within the last 1.5 seconds
