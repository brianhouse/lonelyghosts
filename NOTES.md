need to flip neighbor logic

this is like $25 a node


/


put tilt sensor on bottom, or at least, it shouldnt touch the piezo, it can trigger itself.

can stick the board out of the side for charging

but what about a switch?

drill out the bottom hole and glue this in there

//

can we detect if it's charging, and if so disable the chirping?


scenario 1: the containers are openable, and clear, so there has to be a drill hole for the piezo, but that's it. this is a pre-made bottle of some kind.

scenario 2: water bottle may not be openable because it's not that sturdy. so, expose switch, and also charging jack. that's the annoying part.


how much this is a sculptural object -- obviously Id have to invest in that more. but the dynamics of the guys themselves are what matters now.


//

the full battery lasted from 17:45 until 00:07. so call it 6 hours. fuck yeah.


started charging at 9:35
still charging at 12:15
was charged at 7:20



//

have you flushed the logs?



lock IP of raspberry pi?



//

first batch, need:
2 switches
2 extensions
2 batteries

second batch, need:
11 feathers
12 switches
12 extensions
12 batteries
