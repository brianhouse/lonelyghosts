need to flip neighbor logic

this is like $25 a node

put tilt sensor on bottom, or at least, it shouldnt touch the piezo, it can trigger itself.

can stick the board out of the side for charging

but what about a switch?

drill out the bottom hole and glue this in there

can we detect if it's charging, and if so disable the chirping?


scenario 1: the containers are openable, and clear, so there has to be a drill hole for the piezo, but that's it. this is a pre-made bottle of some kind.

scenario 2: water bottle may not be openable because it's not that sturdy. so, expose switch, and also charging jack. that's the annoying part.


how much this is a sculptural object -- obviously Id have to invest in that more. but the dynamics of the guys themselves are what matters now.
