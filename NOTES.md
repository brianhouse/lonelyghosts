===> 

- eliminate bump delay
- shorten the sound 
- have scan mode disrupt the whole group

this is implemented but not tested



the other version would be an RGB light where the color syncs.
how would that work?

- could have a common reference, so that phase position relative to the absolute would give you the color. but that's not really autonomous then. 

- server could assign based on groups

- everytime a bump is received while cycle<0.8, color is randomized -- if fires without interruption, turns white.

- nah. keep it pure.

does resist need to come back? at some point that went away.

- really see how slow converge can be

--> it really does have to be pitch black
--> 72 more of these fuckers. could do it for $2k. I just spent 2k on the book.
